# Lenovo T530 Hackinosh OpenCore (DSTD-less)

An EFI Folder with configs for running macOS Catalina and Big Sur with either a patched DSDT or DSDT-less.

The EFI for running macOS on the Lenovo T530 includes 2 configs:

1. config_DSDT.plist

This is 100% working for T530 Models wih both HD (AAPL,ig-platform-id 03006601) and HD+ Displays (AAPL,ig-platform-id 04006601). If you just want to have
a well running System, use this!

ATTENTION: You need to rename this config to config.plist in order to boot with this. You can't Boot Windows from within the BootPicker of OpenCore if you 
have Dual Boot Setup using a single HDD/SSD for both Windows and MacOS.

In this config, have a look at ACPI > Add and enable either DSDT-HD.aml or DSDT-HD+.aml (never both) depending on the Display Panel your Lenovo T530 uses. Check the comments to decide which one you need.

2. config_DSDT-less.plist

This config runs macOS without a patched DSDT making use of ACPI Hotpatches (SSDT files and ACPI patches in the config). This is independent of the installed BIOS Version and also runs smoother and snappier. The current config is for T530 Models with HD+ Displays (Resolution â‰¥1600x900 px). If you have a Laptop with a lower resolution you need to add the correct Framebuffer-Patch for IntelHD 4000 (AAPL,ig-platform-id 03006601).

Unfortunately, this config is currently not working 100% perfect yet. 

Currently not working:
- Lid: Sleep/Clamshell Mode and switching over the Main Display to an External Monitor when the lid is closed
- Power LED keeps pulsing after exiting sleep

Any help on getting this fixed is highly appreciated.

Files are coming soon. I need to familiarize with how uploafing the EFI on github works first.

PREPARATIONS:

Before copying the EFI onto your SSD/HDD you should check the Following specs:

- You should test the EFI using a FAT32 formatted USB Stick
- Copy over existing PlatformInfo > Generic information (Catalina needs MacBookPro10,1; Big Sur needs MacBookPro11,2) or create a new one using GenSMBIOS
- SSDT-PM.aml inside the ACPI Folder is for an i7 3630QM Processor. If you have a differnt Model, disable it and create your own using ssdtPRGEN in Postinstall
- If you use a Broadcom card for Bluetooth and Wifi you need to either add BrcmFirmwareData.kext to EFI > OC > Kexts or install BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext to S/L/E to get Bluetooth working
- If you use a different Brand than Broadcom for Bluetooth/Wifi should replace the Kexts for networking for your device and update your config.

INSTALLATION (into ESP):

1. Rename the config file of your choice to config.plist
2. Mount EFI
3. Replace EFI Folder
4. Restart
5. Perform NVRAM Reset (in Bootpicker, hit Space Bar and select Clean NVRAM). Especially important when switching from a DSDT to DSDT-less config!!!
6. Reboot again
7. Select macOS to boot. It's currently configured for running Catalina. If you want to run Big Sur, you need to use SMBIOS 11,x. You can research a suitable/matching SMBIOS for your CPU on everymac.com
